# pySFC
Implementation of Sequential Function Charts in python

This is an attempt to implement a simple SFCs execution machine in python.

SFC is a graphical programming language among the languages identified by the IEC 61131-3 programming
languages and standard for PLC programming.  An SFC is a graphical tool for designing the program logic
for a plc, and allows hierarchies for the control and shutdown sequences to be discussed with engineers
and process operators without them needing to have knowledge of ladder logic or function blocks in which the
program might be implemented.  

Having designed the program flow using an SFC it is then straightforward to translate this to (say)
ladder logic in a simple step-by-step procedure.
